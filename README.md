# NNX

_**N**eural **N**etworks for JA**X**_

NNX is a Neural Networks library for JAX that provides a simple yet powerful module system that adheres to standard Python semantics. Its aim is to combine the robustness of [Flax](https://flax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) with a simplified, Pythonic API akin to that of [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/).

* **Pythonic**: Modules are just regular python classes, they contain their own state, are fully mutable, and allow sharing references between Modules.
* **Fully Compatible**: Easy convert back and forth between Modules and pure pytrees compatible with any JAX transformation and other JAX tooling.
* **Safe**: NNX incorporates mechanisms to try to prevent tracer leakage, avoid stale RNGs, and ensure proper state propagation in order to help produce correct JAX programs.
* **Semantic**: Partition a Module's state into different semantic collections, allowing for fine-grained control when applying JAX transformations.
* **Lifted Transforms**: NNX offers a set of Module-aware transforms that automatically manage the Module's state and provide APIs to instruct the underlying JAX transform how to handle each state collection.

## Installation

To get started with `nnx`, install the package via pip:

```
pip install nnx
```
For the most recent version, install directly from our GitHub repository:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/cgarciae/nnx
```

## Getting Started

The following example guides you through creating a basic `Linear` model with NNX and executing a forward pass. It also demonstrate how handle mutable state by showing how to keep track of the number of times the model has been called.

```python
import nnx
import jax
import jax.numpy as jnp

class Linear(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, din: int, dout: int, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        key = ctx.make_rng("params")
        self.w = nnx.param(jax.random.uniform(key, (din, dout)))
        self.b = nnx.param(jnp.zeros((dout,)))
        self.count = nnx.var("counts", 0)  # track the number of calls

    def __call__(self, x):
        self.count += 1
        return x @ self.w + self.b

ctx = nnx.Context(params=jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
model = Linear(din=12, dout=2, ctx=ctx)

# Forward pass and verify the call count
x = jnp.ones((8, 12))
y = model(x)
assert model.count == 1
```

### Training

Here we show case two different approaches to training the model defined in the previous secition. The first one uses lifted transforms and the second one uses the functional API. Both approaches are equivalent and produce the same results.

<details><summary>Lifted Transforms</summary>

In this example, we uset the `nnx.jit` and `nnx.grad` lifted transforms to define the training step. The model is trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) and `train_step` doesn't require a return statement in this case as the model's state is automatically updated.

```python
@nnx.jit
def train_step(model, x, y):
    def loss_fn(model):
        y_pred = model(x)
        return jax.numpy.mean((y_pred - y) ** 2)
    
    # compute gradient
    grads: nnx.State = nnx.grad(loss_fn, wrt="params")(model)
    # SGD update
    model.update_state(
        jax.tree_map(lambda w, g: w - 0.1 * g, model.filter("params"), grads)
    )

# execute the training step
train_step(model, x, y)
assert model.count == 2
```

**Note**: Using `nnx.jit` can introduce some overhead when compared to using `jax.jit` directly. Use `nnx.jit` for simple prototypes and getting started quickly. For more advanced use cases, use the functional API.

</details>

<details><summary>Functional API </summary>

In this example, we utilize the functional API for training. This approach provides more control over the state and allows you to use regular JAX transformations. The model is also trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD).

```python
(params, counts), moduledef = model.partition("params", "counts")

@jax.jit
def train_step(params, counts, x, y):
    def loss_fn(params):
        y_pred, (updates, _) = moduledef.apply(params, counts)(x)
        loss = jax.numpy.mean((y_pred - y) ** 2)
        return loss, updates.filter("counts")

    # compute gradient
    grads, counts = jax.grad(loss_fn, has_aux=True)(params)
    # SGD update
    params = jax.tree_map(lambda w, g: w - 0.1 * g, params, grads)

    return params, counts

# execute the training step
params, counts = train_step(params, counts, x, y)
model = moduledef.merge(params, counts)
assert model.count == 2
```

## FAQs

### Status
NNX is still in early development so expect bugs and breaking changes. That said, current API is the result of months of experimentation and we don't expect any major changes in the near future.

### How is it different from Flax?
NNX takes the best features that allow Flax to scale to large projects and integrates them into a much simpler Module system with pythonic semantics. 

One place in which NNX strongly deviates from Flax is that (currently) it avoids shape inference in favor of static initialization. It is not a technical limitation but rather a design choice. This design both simplifies the internal implementation and makes it easier to reason about the code for the user, at the cost of being more verbose at times. On the other hand, Pytorch users will feel right at home.

### How is it different from Equinox?
While they might look similar at a surface-level, NNX's Module system is more powerful and flexible than Equinox's, it contains the following additional features:

* Uses regular python classes (no mandatory dataclass behavior).
* Modules are mutable
* Reference sharing between Modules is allowed
* Mutable state lives inside the Module (no need for a separate [State container](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/examples/stateful/)).
* Supports node metadata and semantic partitioning.

One major difference between the two frameworks is that, by design, NNX Modules are not Pytrees. This adds a safety layer as it prevents state updates from being lost by accident due to referential transparency. It also removes the need of threading a separate [State container](https://docs.kidger.site/equinox/examples/stateful/) throughout the code in order to propagate state. In NNX state updates are either always preserved or explicitly discarded by the user.

## User Guide

### Modules

NNX Modules are normal python classes, they obey regular python semantics such as mutability and reference sharing, including reference cycles. They can contain 2 types of attributes: node attributes and static attributes. Node attributes include NNX `Variable`s (e.g. `nnx.param`), Numpy arrays, JAX arrays, submodules Modules, and other NNX types. All other types are treated as static attributes.

```python
class Foo(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, ctx: nnx.Context):
        # node attributes
        self.variable = nnx.param(jnp.array(1))
        self.np_buffer = np.array(2)
        self.jax_buffer = jnp.array(3)
        self.node = nnx.node([4, 5])
        self.submodule = nnx.Linear(2, 4, ctx=ctx)
        # static attributes
        self.int = 1
        self.float = 2.0
        self.str = "hello"
        self.list = [1, 2, 3]

ctx = nnx.Context(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
model = Foo(din=12, dout=2, ctx=ctx)
```
As shown above, python container types such as `list`, `tuple`, and `dict` are treated as static attributes, if similar functionality is needed, NNX provides the `Sequence` and `Map` Modules.

### Functional API

NNX Modules are not pytrees so they cannot be passed to JAX transformations. In order to interact with JAX, a Module must be partitioned into a `State` and `ModuleDef` objects. The `State` object is a flat dictionary-like pytree structure that contains all the deduplicated node attributes, and the `ModuleDef` contains the static attributes and structural information needed to reconstruct the Module.

```python
state, moduledef = model.partition()
```
```
State({
  ('jax_buffer',): Array(3),
  ('node',): Node(value=[4, 5]),
  ('np_buffer',): array(2),
  ('submodule', 'bias'): Variable(collection='params', value=Array(...)),
  ('submodule', 'kernel'): Variable(collection='params', value=Array(...)),
  ('variable',): Variable(collection='params', value=Array(1))
})
```

`State` and `ModuleDef` are pytrees so they can be passed to JAX transformations. More over, `ModuleDef` provides 2 very important methods: `merge` and `apply`. The `merge` method can be used to create a new `Module` from a `State` object:

```python
model = moduledef.merge(state)
```
This can be use to e.g. recreate a module inside a JAX transformation. The `apply` provides a functional interface to the module, it can be used call any method or submodule and get the output and the updated state:

```python
# run __call__
y, (state, moduledef) = moduledef.apply(state)(x)
# run some_method
y, (state, moduledef) = moduledef.apply(state).some_method(x)
# run submodule
y, (state, moduledef) = moduledef.apply(state).submodule(x)
```

`apply` can call any nested method or submodule as long as it can be accessed via the `.` or `[]` operators.

### Partitioning State
`nnx.var` lets you create `Variable` attributes with `collection` metadata, this metadata can be used to partition the state into multiple substates. `nnx.param` is a special case of `nnx.var` where `collection="params"`. 

Here are various examples of how you can use the `partition` method along with collection names to partition a module into multiple substates:

```python
# partition the module into the state with all the nodes and the moduledef
state, moduledef = model.partition()
# verify that the state contains only params, else raise an error
params, moduledef = model.partition("params")
# split the state into params and batch_stats, verify no nodes are left
(params, batch_stats), moduledef = model.partition("params", "batch_stats")
# if there are any nodes left, use the `...` filter to capture them
(params, batch_stats, rest), moduledef = model.partition("params", "batch_stats", ...)
# using `...` as the only filter is equivalent to not passing any filters
model.partition(...) = model.partition()
```
`partition` will make sure all nodes are match by atleast one filter, else it will raise an error. If you have non-`Variable` nodes like `nnx.node`, `jax.Array`, or `numpy.ndarray` attributes, you can use the `...` filter which will match any node. For a more general filter you can pass a predicate function of the form:

```python
(path: Tuple[str, ...], value: Any) -> bool
```

To reconstruct the module from a set of substates, you can use `merge` as usual but passing the substates as additional arguments:

```python
model = moduledef.merge(params, batch_stats, rest)
```

The same is true for `apply`.

```python
y, (state, moduledef) = moduledef.apply(params, batch_stats, rest)(x)
```

 Note that `apply` will return a single `state` object, if you need to re-partition the state you can use `State`'s own `partition` method:

```python
params, batch_stats, rest = state.partition("params", "batch_stats", ...)
```

Alternatively, if you are just interested in a subset of partitions, you can use the `State.filter` method which will not raise an error if some nodes are not matched by any filter:

```python
# only get params
params = state.filter("params")
# get params and batch_stats
params, batch_stats = state.filter("params", "batch_stats")
```

### Capturing Intermediate Values
In NNX you can easily propagate intemediate values by simply assigning them to an attribute at runtime. For convenience, you should assign them to a `Variable` attribute with a `collection` name by using `nnx.var` so you can easily retrieve them later.

Here is an example of how to create a `Linear` module that captures its output into a `Variable` attribute with the `intermediates` collection name:

```python
class Linear(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, din: int, dout: int, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        key = ctx.make_rng("params")
        self.w = nnx.param(jax.random.uniform(key, (din, dout)))
        self.b = nnx.param(jnp.zeros((dout,)))

    def __call__(self, x):
        y = x @ self.w + self.b
        self.y = nnx.var("intermediates", y)
        return y

ctx = nnx.Context(jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
model = Linear(12, 2, ctx=ctx)
```
Since `y` is only created when the module is called, it is not available upon initialization. However, once you call the module `y` will be created. It is recommended that you use `pop_state` to retrieve temporary collections like `intermediates`:

```python
y = model(jnp.ones((8, 12)))
intermediates = model.pop_state("intermediates")
```
`pop_state` will return a `State` object with the nodes that match the given filter and remove them from the module's attributes.

```
State({
  ('y',): Variable(
    collection='intermediates',
    value=Array(...)
  )
})
```

If you use the functional API to call the module instead, the `intermediates` nodes will be present in the output `state`. To retrieve the `intermediates` nodes and optionally separate them from the output `state` you can use `State.partition`:

```python
state, moduledef = model.partition()
y, (state, moduledef) = moduledef.apply(state)(jnp.ones((8, 12)))
# "pop" the intermediates from the state
intermediates, state = state.partition("intermediates", ...)
```

Alternatively, you can use `State.filter` to retrieve the `intermediates` nodes without removing them from the `state`.



### Stateful Transforms

Stateful transforms take a Module as their first argument, track changes in the state that occur within the transformation, and automatically propagate those changes to the input Module outside the transformation. In general, they behave as stateful functions with respect to the first argument.

Here's a diagram illustrating how stateful transformations work:

![stateful-transforms](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cgarciae/nnx/main/docs/images/stateful-transforms.png)

Currently, `nnx.jit` and `nnx.grad` are the only stateful transformations.

The following example demonstrates how a `train_step` function can be implemented using `nnx.jit` and `nnx.grad`:

```python
@nnx.jit
def train_step(model, x, y):

    def loss_fn(model):
        y_pred = model(x)
        return jax.numpy.mean((y_pred - y) ** 2)
    
    # compute gradient
    grads: nnx.State = nnx.grad(loss_fn, wrt="params")(model)
    # SGD update
    model.update_state(
        jax.tree_map(lambda w, g: w - 0.1 * g, model.filter("params"), grads)
    )

# stateful update
train_step(model, x, y)
```

The most interesting aspect of this design is that the code appears very imperative, as the state is automatically propagated in and out of the transformations.


### Case Studies
#### Shared State

In NNX, you can create modules that share state between them. This is useful when designing complex neural network architectures, as it allows you to reuse certain layers and reduce the number of learnable parameters.

Here's an example of creating a module with shared state:

```python
class Block(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, linear: nnx.Linear, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        self.linear = linear
        self.bn = nnx.BatchNorm(2, ctx=ctx)

    def __call__(self, x, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        x = self.linear(x)
        x = self.bn(x, ctx=ctx)
        x = nnx.relu(x)
        return x

class Model(nnx.Module):
    def __init__(self, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        shared = nnx.Linear(2, 2, ctx=ctx)
        self.block1 = Block(shared, ctx=ctx)
        self.block2 = Block(shared, ctx=ctx)

    def __call__(self, x, *, ctx: nnx.Context):
        x = self.block1(x, ctx=ctx)
        x = self.block2(x, ctx=ctx)
        return x
```

In this example, the `Model` module contains two instances of the `Block` module. Each instance shares the same `nnx.Linear` module. To run the model, you can use the Context `flags` argument to set the `use_running_average` flag for all `BatchNorm` modules.

Here's an example of computing the loss for a `Model` instance:

```python
def loss_fn(model: Model, x: jax.Array, y: jax.Array):
    ctx = nnx.Context(flags=dict(use_running_average=True))
    y_pred = model(x, ctx=ctx)
    return jnp.mean((y - y_pred) ** 2)
```

It's important to note that the state for the shared `nnx.Linear` module will be kept in sync at all times on both `Block` instances, including during gradient updates.
